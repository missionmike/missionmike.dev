  Growing a career as a software developer is a challenging and rewarding effort. Here's some things
  that have proven to help me along my own journey. Perhaps they'll help you also.

## Part I: Internal Growth

My first role in tech was **not** as a software developer. My first title was "Junior Graphic
Designer" in a small company of about 40 people.

Within 6 years my role grew to "Lead Developer / Designer" and I eventually left the company after 8
years for a fullstack developer role elsewhere.

In order to grow internally at the _first_ company and prepare to make an eventual jump for a more
fulfilling role, I had to first learn a few new things to increase my value.

Below are some key values and specific decisions which led to steady _internal growth_ in my first
position. These are steps which took me outside of my comfort zone and pushed my limits; I believe
these steps are universal in nature and can be applied to many careers, but are especially relevant
to software development and engineering.

## 1. Don't Settle: Push Boundaries

All websites and applications, no matter how impressive, have something in common: _people built
them._ People no different from you or me. People who worked hard, tried new things, and _maybe_ got
a little lucky along the way.

### Everything can be created.

_"I can't build that"_ is not a valid excuse working in the modern web. There's an incredible amount
of open source projects, tutorials, and blog posts, etc. at our disposal to learn from. Nothing is
impossible to create, and breakthroughs happen every day. With time and dedication to learning, much
can be accomplished.

If I limited myself to what I already knew, or what I'd already tried and had success with, I would
not have grown at all.

<Aside>

### Personal Case Study: Pushing Boundaries

Early in my tenure with <a href="https://www.rrfedu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RRFC</a>, I
noticed an internal software development need. The company was relying on a 3rd-party start-up
vendor for their learning management software to teach students online and in hybrid learning
scenarios.

This software was a no-code solution. It ran smoothly, but having little control of it made me
uncomfortable. I felt that the company and offerings to students could grow if we had the freedom
and ability to expand our own platform, crafting it to fit our specific needs.

Some questions that ran through my mind as I realized this need:

- What if the 3rd-party company went under? How would we quickly recover?
- What if they suddenly became very popular and raised their prices?
- What did they offer which we couldn't replicate in-house?
- How can we add our own features needed to improve student experience and meet strict state
  licensing requirements?

#### The Action

I drafted up an email pitch to upper management. I clearly outlined the opportunity I saw to expand
the company's digital footprint and improve their offerings using a _new software which could be
developed in-house._ Something that they could **own**.

**The email was well-received,** and I was given the priviledge to spearhead this project! The work
ended up spanning two years, and I was the sole developer and designer for the majority of the work.

This was an opportunity to grow my development skills while providing new value. **Important note: I
did not know how I was going to build this!** I only knew that it _could be done._

This faith in myself and understanding that all technical things are possible with time and learning
was the launchpad for the next phase of my career. This work became a milestone on my resume, but it
took a lot of dedication.

</Aside>

## 2. Stay Informed & Network

This may go without saying for many people, but it's still important enough to reiterate here. For
my first few years as a developer (this might sound silly), I did not know there was an actual
_developer community_ out there!

I went to community college and made a few acquaintances, but most of us in class were flying solo.
There were no real collaborative team dev projects, like you would find in the real world. This
experience was not an accurate reflection of real software development, where team integration is a
critical skill.

### I stumbled on the developer community by accident.

There are a myriad of podcasts and highly-visible software developers out there; find your preferred
technology and then search for relevant podcasts. There's a fit for everyone!

Twitter and LinkedIn can be an exceptional place to connect and interact with other professional
developers - many of whom have worked on or created the very libraries and packages you use every
day. Following people who have made significant contributions to technology is rewarding and very
accessible.

<Aside>

### Personal Case Study: Staying Informed

I stumbled across the [syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/) Podcast and my life as a developer was
changed. Listening to [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/) and [Scott Tolinski](https://levelup.video/)
discuss web development trends and technology really struck a chord with me &mdash; and it provided
a productive way to pass time during a commute!

At this point in my career I was working mostly remote, however I had to commute to the city once a
week to meet with the execs in the office. It was typically a 1 to 2-hour drive each way, and
listening to the Syntax podcast during the drive not only made it bearable &mdash; it made it _fun_.

I'd listen to their interviews and guests, and noted names and different new technologies that I
wanted to test out. I would start Googling and researching them as soon as I could open up my laptop
at the office.

**What made this podcast really cool?** The hosts, although quite popular and deep in the trenches
of cutting-edge web development, _are really open with their social media presence!_ They're down to
earth, easy to find online, and you can follow them on Twitter. This was like a peek into how
top-tier software developers interact online.

#### Additional Suggestion: Listen to AudioBooks

I also capitalized on the commute time by listening to various audio books, some of which include:

- [How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006IU7JK/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title_ab_amzn)
- [Critical Business Skills for Success](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VSWXFB0/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title_ab_amzn)
- [Never Split the Difference: Negotiating as if Your Life Depended On It](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01COR1GM2/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title_ab_amzn)
- [Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D24NAL6/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title_ab_amzn)
- [48 Laws of Power](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X0TKUS0/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title_ab_amzn)

- [The Influential Mind: What the Brain Reveals About Our Power to Change Others](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0752VTD6T/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title_ab_amzn)

These topics helped prepare me to advance within the company, and to navigate some challenging
negotiations and meetings.

## 3. Automate Yourself: Work Different

I've come across the notion that some developers feel the need to keep themselves employed by
overcomplicating their work. The thought is that if they make their work so overly complex, nobody
else can take it over and their tenure with the company is guaranteed.

The truth is, that there are countless developers out there who not only _can_ take it over, but
they _will gladly_ do so. Over-complicating your work for job security only makes their onboarding a
bit more challenging.

I've found the opposite effort to be true: **automate yourself.**

If you find opportunity to automate yourself out of a task, do it. Don't hang on to doing something
just because it keeps you busy or it keeps the company dependent on you. There's more exciting work
around the corner to focus on.

<Aside>

### Personal Case Study: Self-Automation

At RRFC, there was a regular need to update a particular set of webpages for state compliance, or to
update forms to track various promotions or lead-gen efforts.

These updates would span across several WordPress websites, and were a repetitive &mdash; but
essential &mdash; task.

After performing a styling and content update task for the dozenth time, I realized there _must_ be
a better way to manage these updates.

#### The Solution: A Custom Plugin &amp; API

I wrote a custom self-hosted WordPress plugin which could be activated within each site. This plugin
would parse [WordPress Shortcodes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API) representing various
data or components. This data or component would be served from a custom API endpoint &mdash; this
allowed me to write code and content once, from one location, and share it across multiple websites.

The plugin was housed in a GitHub repository, and WordPress websites would fetch the plugin updates
directly from GitHub &mdash; so updating the plugin was a breeze.

Each website would serve content served by a separate WordPress API in the style and functionality
of the particular destination website, however the core data and content would be fetched from one
universal location. Write once, share everywhere.

The initial setup for this process took a little bit of extra time to get off the ground, but once
it was up and running it greatly freed up my time to allow me to focus on higher priority &mdash;
and more fun &mdash; tasks.

</Aside>

## In Closing

At the end of the day, it's all about self-improvement and progression. When I found myself working
repetitively, or stagnant, I became restless. The solution was typically to get outside my comfort
zone, try new things, and learn.

The beauty of a software development career is that it's never stale. New technology and techniques
are available nearly every day. There is no shortage of innovation and ideas.

The best software engineers continue to learn and grow, remain humble, and never settle for the
routine for too long.

Enjoy the journey!
