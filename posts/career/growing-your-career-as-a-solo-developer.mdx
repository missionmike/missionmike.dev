## "I develop alone. How can I prepare to level up my skills?"

When I found myself developing solo for an extensive amount of time, I began to realize the great
need to level up my skills to increase my worth to the company as well as open doors to new
oppotunities. Here's some steps I took to level up my skills.

None of this happened overnight. This effort spanned years. However, I can confidently pinpoint some
specific decisions that I made over the years which greatly impacted my career in a positive way.

Some might call it "playing the long game," and they'd be right. It's all about preparation and
steady personal growth. If you invest in yourself, opportunities will arise.

## Background

My first role in tech was **not** as a software developer. My first title was Junior Graphic
Designer within a small company. I had web development experience which I picked up during high
school and college; I had created a few websites, but I didn't have extensive development
experience.

Within my first few months on board as a Junior Graphic Designer, however, it became clear that the
company also had development needs. So I stepped up to offer my skills. I was familiar enough with
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL to be dangerous, and I began helping the resident developer
chip away at some mundane repetitive template modification.

It wasn't long before I attempted larger-scale tasks.

My first larger task was to learn WordPress and build a WordPress theme. The Senior Developer on the
team was kind enough to show me the ropes and point me to some learning resources for WordPress.
After several months, I became more fluent in the framework.

I could have remained content working on standard WordPress themes and plugins, but I yearned for
more.
