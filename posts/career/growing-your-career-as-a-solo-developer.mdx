  Growing a career as a software developer is a challenging and rewarding effort. Here's some things
  that have proven to help me along my own journey. Perhaps they'll help you also.

## Part I: Internal Growth

My first role in tech was **not** as a software developer. My first title was "Junior Graphic
Designer" in a small company of roughly 40 people.

Within 6 years my role grew to "Lead Developer / Designer" and I eventually left the company after 8
years for a fullstack developer role elsewhere.

In order to grow internally at the _first_ company and prepare to make an eventual jump for a more
fulfilling role, I had to first learn a few new things to increase my value.

Below are some key values and specific decisions which led to steady _internal growth_ in my first
position. These are steps which took me outside of my comfort zone and pushed my limits; I believe
these steps are universal in nature and can be applied to many careers, but are especially relevant
to software development and engineering.

## 1. Don't Settle: Push Boundaries

All websites and applications, no matter how complex or elegant, have something in common: _people
built them._ People no different from you or me. People who worked hard, tried new things, and
_maybe_ got a little lucky along the way.

### Everything can be created.

_"I can't build that"_ is not a valid excuse working in the modern web. There's an incredible amount
of open source projects, tutorials, and blog posts, etc. at our disposal to learn from. Nothing is
impossible to create, and breakthroughs happen every day. With time and dedication to learning, much
can be accomplished.

If I limited myself to what I already knew, or what I'd already tried and had success with, I would
not have grown at all.

### Personal Case Study: Pushing Boundaries

Early in my tenure with <a href="https://www.rrfedu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RRFC</a>, I
noticed an internal software development need. The company was relying on a 3rd-party start-up
vendor for their learning management software to teach students online and in hybrid learning
scenarios.

This software was essentially a no-code solution. The software ran smoothly, but being a school that
offered electronic curriculum provided through a platform that _we had little control of_ made me
uncomfortable. I felt that the company and offerings could grow if we had the freedom and ability to
expand our own platform, crafting it to fit our specific needs.

Some questions that went through my mind as I realized this need:

- What if the 3rd-party company went under?
- What if they suddenly became very popular and raised their prices significantly?
- What did they offer which we couldn't replicate in-house?
- How can we add our own features needed to improve student experience and meet strict state
  licensing requirements?

#### The Action

I drafted up a well-crafted email pitch to upper management. I clearly outlined the opportunity I
saw to expand the company's digital footprint and improve their offerings using a _new software
which could be developed in-house._ Something that they could **own**.

**The email was well-received,** and I was given the priviledge to spearhead this project! The work
ended up spanning two years, and I was the sole developer and designer for the majority of the work.

This was an opportunity to grow my development skills while providing new value. **I did not know
how I was going to build this!** I only knew that it _could be done._

This faith in myself, and understanding that all technical things are possible with time and
learning, was the launchpad for the next phase of my career. This work became a milestone on my
resume, but it took lots of dedication.

## 2. Stay Informed & Network

This may go without saying for many people, but it's still important enough to reiterate here. For
my first few years as a developer (this might sound silly), I did not know there was an actual
_developer community_ out there!

I went to community college and made a few acquaintances, but most of us in class were flying solo.
There were no real collaborative team dev projects, like you would find in the real world. This
experience was not an accurate reflection of real software development, where team integration is a
critical skill.

### I stumbled on the developer community by accident.

I stumbled across [syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/) and my life was changed. Listening to
[Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/) and [Scott Tolinski](https://levelup.video/) discuss web development
trends and technology really struck a chord with me &mdash; and it provided a productive way to pass
time during a commute!

There are a myriad of podcasts and highly-visible software developers out there; find your preferred
technology and then search for relevant podcasts. There's a fit for everyone!

Twitter and LinkedIn can be an exceptional place to connect and interact with other professional
developers - many of whom have worked on or created the very libraries and packages you use every
day. Following people who have made significant contributions to technology is rewarding and very
accessible.

<Aside>

### Personal Case Study: Staying Informed

At this point in my career I was working mostly remote, however I had to commute to the city once a
week to meet with the execs in the office. It was typically a 2-hour drive each way, and listening
to the Syntax podcast during the drive not only made it bearable &mdash; it made it fun.

I'd listen to their interviews and guests, and noted names and different new technologies that I
wanted to test out. I would start Googling and researching them as soon as I could open up my laptop
at the office.

**What made this podcast really cool?** The hosts, although quite popular and deep in the trenches
of cutting-edge web development, _are really open with their social media presence!_ They're down to
earth, easy to find online, and you can follow them on Twitter. This was like a peek into how
top-tier software developers interact online.

</Aside>

### 3. Automate Yourself

I've come across the notion that developers feel the need to keep themselves employed by
overcomplicating their work. The thought is that if they make their work so overly complex, nobody
else can take it over.

The truth is, that there are countless developers out there who not only _can_ take it over, but
they _will gladly_ do so. Over-complicating your work for job security only makes their onboarding a
bit more challenging.

I've found the opposite effort to be true: automate yourself.
