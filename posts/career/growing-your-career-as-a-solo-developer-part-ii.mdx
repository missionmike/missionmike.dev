## Part II: Preparing to Jump

### 1. Act as If

Using version control software is a non-negotiable requirement in modern software development.
Learning to leverage git was a critical stepping stone for my growth.

## Making a Jump

After several years within the same company, I realized I hit a ceiling for growth. There was
nowhere to grow internally, and my compensation was not going to improve.

At this point, I realized I needed to make a jump. But how?

### "I develop alone. How can level up my skills?"

When I found myself developing solo for an extensive amount of time, I began to realize the great
need to level up my skills in order to increase my worth to the company, as well as to explore new
oppotunities. Here are some steps I took to level up my skills.

None of this happened overnight. This effort spanned years. However, I can confidently pinpoint some
specific decisions made over the years which greatly impacted my career in a positive way.

Some might call it "playing the long game," and they'd be right. It's all about preparation and
steady personal growth. If you invest in yourself, opportunities will arise.
